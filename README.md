# Portfolio - Issam Mezdagat

A minimalist, tech-focused portfolio website with neon aesthetics and 3D effects.

## 🚀 How to Run

Since this project uses ES Modules (for Three.js), you need to serve it via a local server to avoid CORS errors.

### Option 1: Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python installed, run this command in the project directory:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server
If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner.
